						<p>Life is a dream and this is why we should NEVER forget that we have control over it. In fact, you should control it at all times. It takes exercise to control your mind but there is no such thing as something for nothing: Look through photographs of different times or empty your old revision cabinet from a time where you used your own mind with persistence day in day out like it was nature, and you will know that what I am talking about is more than just theory.</p>
                                                <p>Sometimes I feel stuck like I am forgetting that I’m only in a dream. Only thing worse is conglomerating with others with the same affliction: these people are not hard to find in my society, and sometimes, though I wish otherwise, they make me ask myself things like: ‘Could my best friend be, in disguise, my worst enemy?’ : an important self-assessment question proposed by Napoleon Hill. This is why I am very selective with my recreational media; my mind is closed tight against negative influences, and to control your mind to do your best work it behoves you to not be reminded of the planet. I suppose that is why you would turn to drugs, an escape, but knowing narcotics are only 10th on the list of mind stimulants I just feel stupid and sorry for myself whenever I’m under the influence of certain drugs, or when in a club, or pursuing the infinte intelligence in stranger ways than those confluent with my master plan.</p>
						<p>The master plan is something you are. It is your mission to exercise yourself such that you can be it. Your master plan is simple, yet nobody is looking for it. A good metaphor would be a quote from the movie The Big Short: ‘These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy, and they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do: They looked.’ This is not to call anybody a sucker, but when there’s only one copy of Think and Grow Rich in my College’s Central Library which is on the shelf unchecked as I type this and the whole college is full of people trying to grow successful and monetise themselves (they’re investing tens of thousands of pounds to see to this end), then you’ve got to begin to call B.S. on the whole thing and take your true path with your whole body and soul.</p>
                                                <p>Your 5 year old self should understand your master plan. He probably wrote most of it.</p>
