						<p>Psycho cybernetics. It is a known fact that you act out what you think of yourself and form the habits you do in spite of things around you. Dr Maxwell Maltz was a plastic surgeon who wrote a book of the strength of the observation in his clients post-operation. For example, doing surgery and changing somebody's face would mean everybody would look at this person differently forever, but what is stressed in the book is that it took no less than 21 days for the clients' behaviour to adjust and for their new life to make its consequent beginning. In essence the change of life is evoked by a change of habits, beliefs and, to a large extent, personality.</p>
						<p>As I read I learn that to control your life by manipulating yourself in such a tacit way would take unprecedented persistence, almost as if you were to behave like you're life was a movie for the world to see and you were not only aware but willing to persist hard enough to really show the world who you are! I think the truth is somewhere shuffled in the past sentence, but for now I'll keep reading.</p>
						<p>If this is anything like surgery, I must expect of myself to train my mind everyday and document.
